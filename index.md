**3DianaAI Telegram Bot**  
Last Updated: September 2025 

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the terms and conditions governing the use of the 3DianaAI Telegram Bot (“the Bot”), as well as our policies regarding the collection, use, and retention of user data.

By accessing or interacting with the Bot, you acknowledge that you are at least 18 years of age and agree to be legally bound by these Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these terms, you must refrain from using the Bot.

## 2. Eligibility and Acceptable Use
Access to the Bot is restricted to individuals who:

- Are at least 18 years of age.  
- Are not prohibited by applicable law from accessing adult-oriented content.  
- Use the Bot solely for personal, non-commercial, and entertainment purposes.  

Prohibited actions include, but are not limited to:

- Using the Bot on behalf of another individual or entity.  
- Reproducing, recording, publishing, distributing, or commercializing any content or responses generated by the Bot.  
- Integrating the Bot or its outputs into other products or services.  
- Attempting to reverse-engineer, automate, or exploit the Bot.  
- Accessing the Bot from jurisdictions where sexually explicit content is restricted or illegal.  

Violation of these provisions may result in immediate suspension or permanent termination of access and may be reported to relevant authorities where applicable.

## 3. Content
The Bot enforces a strict zero-tolerance policy for any content involving, referencing, or implying underage individuals in a sexual or suggestive context. This includes, without limitation:

- Characters described as being under 18 years of age (real or fictional).  
- Age regression, infantilization, or youth-based personas.  
- Lolicon, shotacon, or similar themes.  

Any violation of this policy will result in the immediate and permanent revocation of access and may be subject to reporting to appropriate authorities.

## 4. Reporting Violations
Users are encouraged to report violations of these Terms, including any content involving minors, illegal activities, or abusive behavior. Reports may be submitted confidentially.  
For contact options, please refer to the Contact section.

We reserve the right to investigate and act upon such reports at our sole discretion.

## 5. Data Collection and Processing
In order to provide an interactive and personalized experience, the Bot may collect and store the following information:

- Telegram user ID.
- Display name or username (if publicly available).
- Message history and conversation metadata.
- Media-related data (captions, transcripts, descriptions).
- Pinned messages.
- Moderation logs of flagged content.

All data is stored locally and is not sold, rented, or shared with third parties. Data is retained for as long as the user remains active unless explicitly deleted upon request.

## 6. AI Generation and Content Moderation
All responses are generated by artificial intelligence. No human staff monitor or intervene in real-time conversations. Automated moderation tools are used to:

- Filter prohibited or harmful content.
- Detect policy violations.
- Enforce access restrictions.

Flagged messages may be suppressed, logged, and may result in user warnings or permanent bans.

## 7. Payments, Credits, and Refunds

### 7.1 Credits
- Credits are an internal virtual unit used exclusively for AI text and voice generation within the Bot.  
- Credits cannot be applied to premium photo, video, or scripted-scenario content. Those assets may be offered for a separate fee.  
- Credits have no cash value, are non-refundable, and are non-transferable.  
- **Expiration:** All purchased Credits expire 30 days after the date of purchase. Unused Credits will be automatically removed from your account after this period.

### 7.2 Payments

### 7.3 Refunds

### 7.4 Compliance with Telegram Rules

- Only Stars are processed natively inside Telegram.

## 8. Data Retention and Deletion
User data is stored for the duration of the user’s active participation. Upon request, users may initiate deletion of all data associated with their Telegram ID. Such requests can be submitted via the official support page.

Deleted data is irreversibly erased and cannot be recovered.

We do not control, and are not responsible for, the data-handling practices of third-party providers.
